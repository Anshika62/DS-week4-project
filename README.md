Project Description – Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes the performance of students in Physics, Chemistry, and Maths. The goal is to complete the full data analysis pipeline—loading the data, cleaning it, analyzing scores, creating charts, and writing insights that explain the patterns found.
I calculated total marks, subject averages, best and weakest subjects, and identified the top and low scorers. I also created two visualizations:
✔ A bar chart showing the average marks in each subject
✔ A line chart showing the total marks of each student

This project helped me understand how to handle data, calculate metrics, and create meaningful charts using pandas and matplotlib.

Steps Followed
Day 1–2: Project Setup
Selected topic: Student Performance Analysis
Created folder structure (data, visualizations, report, code)

Day 3: Data Exploration
Loaded dataset using pandas
Checked structure (columns, values)
Verified subject marks

Day 4: Basic Analysis
Calculated total marks for each student
Calculated subject-wise averages
Identified best and weakest subject
Found highest and lowest scoring students

Day 5: Visualizations
Bar chart of average marks per subject
Line chart of total marks of students

Day 6: Insights Writing
Wrote meaningful observations from charts and analysis

Day 7: Final Submission
Cleaned code
Organized files

Tested the project

Prepared documentation
